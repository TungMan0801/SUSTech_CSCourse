# SUSTech_CSCourse_Review

Hi I am tung!!:)

## Intro

It's a repo to record those notes I made before.
Actually after a shutting down on my computer in May 2022, I lost many important files. So I only upload some files available.（；´д｀）ゞAnd it also reminds me that recording is a good habit.

I made those review for that chasing the deadline and making review is an efficient way for me. But it's not a good example, if you do not want to stay up for days. So that those reviews will cover most of the knowledge we have learned for it is kind of a '' Rocket class''. But don't expect to master this course after only reading these, you and me both know what should we do.

So if you still have time, please just start getting your hands dirty!🙋‍♀️



I might make some mistakes or did not finish all the work of some course, which means I can not guarantee every word and knowledge I wrote is useful and correct. 
Please help me and yourself distinguish them! Leave a issue whenever you like!

**I hope younger CS students can have a easier way than me, so I shared those notes. If you think it useful, please leave me a star, follow me or leave some comments!!XD**
